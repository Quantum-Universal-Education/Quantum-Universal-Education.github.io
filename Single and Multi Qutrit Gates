Today Quantum computing has gained importance, as we need to have more computing power for transmitting large amount of data. Use of bits to transfer data, 
limits the amount of data and power as bits are capable of transmitting data in only two states namely 0 and 1. Qubits and Qutrits facilitate transmitting data in multiple states. 
This approach creates more states compared to those provided by bits.
