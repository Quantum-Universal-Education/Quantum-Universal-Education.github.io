Lia Yeh has recently graduated BS Computing and BS Physics from the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she researched microwave spectroscopy algorithms.  She researched quantum compilers in the Quantum Undergraduate Research at IBM and Princeton program last summer and is about to start her Computer Science DPhil study in the Quantum Group at the University of Oxford. She is very passionate about STEM education and outreach, and co-founded WomxnHacks, an annual weekend-long hackathon for ~200 female-identifying and non-gender-binary college students of all levels of programming experience especially none.

Hello, my name is Ricky Kienhoefer. I'm a rising senior at the University of Nevada, Reno studying Physics and Engineering Physics. I am currently researching molecular vibrations with quantum ESPRESSO, building an scanning tunneling microscope with my research group, and designing a machine to sharpen the silver tips for it. I am very excited about the possibilities of quantum computing for solid-state physics, and passionate about providing resources for others.
